# Caviens-Arena
A text-based card game pitting two duellists against each other in a magical arena. Written in Python.
The core mechanics function properly, but gameplay balance is still a work in progress, and some features (e.g. AI opponent) are also still a work in progress.

Cards.txt must be in the same folder as the .py file for the program to function. Instructions on how to make custom cards can be found in comments in the code.
The game should be played by running the .py file directly rather than running the program from the shell, as the text is not formatted correctly in the shell.
