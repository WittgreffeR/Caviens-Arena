# Caviens-Arena
A text-based card game pitting two duellists against each other in a magical arena. Written in Python.
Currently lacking some planned features and the gameplay is not well-balanced, but the core mechanics function properly.

Cards.txt must be in the same folder as the .py file for the program to function. Instructions on how to make custom cards can be found in comments in the code.
The game should be played by running the .py file directly rather than running the program from the shell, as the text is not formatted correctly in the shell.
