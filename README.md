# Caviens-Arena
A text-based card game pitting two duellists against each other in a magical arena, with a customisable card deck.

Written in Python. The code builds a deck of cards from Cards.txt and stores them in a 2D list. The first layer of the list is each card, and the second layer is the values of the card.

Cards.txt must be in the same folder as the .py file for the program to function. Instructions on how to make custom cards can be found in comments in the code.
The game should be played by running the .py file directly rather than running the program from the shell, otherwise the text will not be formatted correctly.

Ongoing developments:
* Improved gameplay balance
* Create AI opponent that makes decisions using weighted random chance
